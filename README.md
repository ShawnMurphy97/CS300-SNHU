# CS300-SNHU
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    I had a client that was looking to develop an application that assisted their advisors with talking to students so that they can better help the students progress through their classes.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    I approached this problem with an open mind. Originally the data structure I was most comfortable with was a vector. Using this would have been possible, I used the knowledge that BST and Hashtables are more flexible than the vector, allowing manipulation of the program in the future if the client so chooses. Doing this increases our reputation with clients as it reduces their costs of having an entire new program developed in the future.
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    One of the major ways I overcame the roadblocks I encountered was by going back through our ZyBooks activities, resources and occassionally if there was a concept that I just did not understand, I would do a little of my own research on the subject.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    My knowledge on data structures has increased immensely, while before I didn't really understand the nuances of them. Now, I find it much easier to follow what is going on within code when dealing with them. Not only this but I also have started to prefer other data structures than Vectors as that was the primary one I had worked with prior to this class.
    
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    As stated in the previous question, this project has allowed me to understand the pros and cons of each of the data structures allowing me to make the proper choice  when it comes to them.
